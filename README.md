# Conqueria Caps - Backend _(IN PROGRESS)_

### About the Game
**Conqueria Caps** is a real-time, strategy-based board game where 2-6 players battle for dominance over territories on a dynamic world map. Each player begins with an equal amount of resources, and they must make strategic decisions to generate income, fortify their defenses, or launch calculated attacks on their opponents. The game spans multiple continents, with cities, outposts, and military units playing pivotal roles in achieving victory. Players can capture territories, deploy defensive structures, launch attack waves, and strategically manage resources to win by capturing enemy capitals or controlling the most land.

Conqueria Caps also features premium in-game options, including exclusive emotes, customizable cosmetics, and premium troops/buildings, ensuring no pay-to-win mechanics.

This repository contains the **backend** source code for **Conqueria Caps**, developed using **FastAPI**, with real-time WebSocket functionality, PostgreSQL for the database, and Redis for caching and real-time updates.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** (version 12+)
- **Redis**
- **Docker** (for containerization, optional but recommended)
- **Git**

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conqueria-caps-backend.git
   cd conqueria-caps-backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database_name>
   REDIS_URL=redis://<hostname>:<port>
   SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
   JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
   OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
   OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
   OAUTH_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=<your_facebook_client_id>
   OAUTH_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_facebook_client_secret>
   OAUTH_STEAM_API_KEY=<your_steam_api_key>
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>
   CHARGEBEE_SITE=<your_chargebee_site>
   CHARGEBEE_API_KEY=<your_chargebee_api_key>
   ```

5. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and create the necessary database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE conqueria_caps;
   ```

   Then apply migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   Start the FastAPI backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Docker Setup (Optional)

You can run the entire backend using Docker for easier deployment and environment setup.

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t conqueria-caps-backend .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name conqueria_backend -p 8000:8000 conqueria-caps-backend
   ```

This will start the backend on `http://localhost:8000`.
